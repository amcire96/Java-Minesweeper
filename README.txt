My Minesweeper project has 9 projects: a Board, Cell, GUI, Listener, LoadImage, Location, MineSweeper, and SoundEffect class.

This project reinforced my understanding into the development of games. 

The game operates using the Board, Cell, Location, and MineSweeper classes.

The GUI creates the graphics for the game with help of the Listener class and LoadImage class.

The SoundEffect class accesses sound clips that are used as sound effects for the game.
